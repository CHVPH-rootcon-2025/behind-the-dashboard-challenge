    lead: `Midsize SUVs are reliable choices for hassle-free family travel, and though it's not a class leader, the Acadia has the goods to satisfy shoppers in this popular segment. This hauler has a spacious, versatile cabin with second-row captain's chairs that slide back and forth. There's seating for up to eight people, and while it's not as roomy as the first two rows, the third row accommodates adults.<br>
    <br>    
     Its infotainment system is one of the Acadia's strong points. The 15-inch touch screen is intuitive and has crisp graphics, and all models have standard features that include wireless smartphone integration and a Wi-Fi hot spot.`,

    lead: `Today's trucks have come a long way since the unrefined haulers of yesteryear, and the Ram 1500 is one of the best examples of this evolution.
